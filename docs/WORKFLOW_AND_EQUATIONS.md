# netSim v1: High-Level Workflow and Governing Equations

This note summarises what the current `netSim` implementation is doing at a
high level, which equations it is solving, and where the present numerical
issue is most likely to be.

The scope of the current solver is:

- steady
- isothermal
- incompressible
- single-component
- pressure-driven pipe networks with fittings

## 1. High-Level Workflow

The current workflow in `src/netSim/solvers/steady_isothermal_incompressible.py`
is:

1. Build the network state from the case definition.
2. Initialise a pressure field for all internal nodes.
3. Run a laminar initialisation stage.
4. Use that state as the initial condition for the turbulent stage.
5. Return nodal pressures and component flow rates.

In more detail:

### Step 1. Build the network

The case defines:

- nodes
- pressure boundaries
- components (`Pipe`, `Fitting`)
- fluid properties

This is converted into a mutable internal state with:

- nodal pressures
- component velocities
- Reynolds numbers
- mass flow rates

### Step 2. Initialise internal pressures

For nodes without prescribed pressure, the code generates a simple
interpolated pressure field between the available pressure boundaries.

This is only a numerical starting point. It is not yet the hydraulic
solution.

### Step 3. Laminar initialisation

The solver computes a provisional flow field using:

- laminar pipe physics for `Pipe`
- the fitting local-loss relation for `Fitting`

Then it assembles and solves a pressure-correction system and updates the
nodal pressures.

This is repeated:

- once for networks with pipes only
- several times for networks with fittings

The idea is:

- pure laminar pipes are effectively linear
- fittings are already nonlinear
- therefore a network with fittings benefits from a few laminar-style
  initialisation passes before the turbulent stage

### Step 4. Turbulent solve

The solver then switches the pipes to the turbulent Darcy-Weisbach plus
Colebrook relation.

At each iteration it:

1. computes a velocity field from the current pressures
2. computes mass flows
3. linearises each component into a coupling coefficient
4. assembles the pressure-correction system
5. solves for pressure correction
6. updates the nodal pressures
7. checks convergence

### Step 5. Convergence

The current turbulent stage stops when the pressure correction and nodal
mass imbalance both become sufficiently small.

Colebrook itself has its own internal residual tolerance.

## 2. Equations Implemented

The current code follows the structure from the original draft reasonably
closely.

Notation:

- `P_i`, `P_j`: pressures at the start and end nodes of a component
- `DeltaP = P_i - P_j`
- `z_i`, `z_j`: elevations
- `Delta z = z_j - z_i`
- `rho`: density
- `mu`: dynamic viscosity
- `g`: gravitational acceleration
- `D`: pipe diameter
- `L`: pipe length
- `A`: cross-sectional area
- `f`: Darcy friction factor
- `K`: fitting loss coefficient
- `V`: average velocity in the component
- `m_dot = rho A V`: mass flow rate

## 2.1 Pipe, laminar

Implemented in `src/netSim/closures/friction.py`.

The current laminar pipe velocity is:

```text
V = (D^2 / (32 mu L)) * (DeltaP - rho g Delta z)
```

This matches the intended form in the draft:

```text
V ~ P_in - P_out - gamma (z_out - z_in)
```

where `gamma = rho g`.

Important:

- the elevation term enters the estimated velocity
- it does not enter the laminar pressure-correction coefficient directly

The laminar coupling used in the pressure-correction system is:

```text
C_lam = -(rho / (32 mu)) * (A D^2 / L)
```

## 2.2 Pipe, turbulent

Also implemented in `src/netSim/closures/friction.py`.

The turbulent pipe update is based on Darcy-Weisbach:

```text
DeltaP - rho g Delta z = (rho f L / (2 D)) * V * abs(V)
```

The present code rearranges this using the previous velocity estimate `V*`:

```text
V_new = 2 D (DeltaP - rho g Delta z) / (rho f L abs(V*))
```

This is consistent with the usual linearisation of:

```text
V * abs(V)
```

instead of:

```text
V^2
```

which is important because `V * abs(V)` preserves flow direction.

The turbulent coupling used in the pressure-correction equation is:

```text
C_turb = -2 A D / (f V L)
```

In practice the implementation uses the current signed velocity. This is one
place where sign sensitivity matters.

## 2.3 Pipe friction factor

The friction factor is found from the Colebrook equation:

```text
1 / sqrt(f) = -2 log10( eps/(3.7 D) + 2.51/(Re sqrt(f)) )
```

with:

```text
Re = rho abs(V) D / mu
```

The current implementation solves Colebrook iteratively by Newton-style
finite-difference updates.

## 2.4 Fittings

Implemented in `src/netSim/closures/minor_losses.py`.

The fitting velocity is currently computed from:

```text
V = sign(DeltaP) * sqrt( 2 abs(DeltaP) / (K rho) )
```

So fittings are not treated as a strictly linear laminar law. They retain
their local-loss relation even during the laminar initialisation stage.

This is important:

- the current "laminar initialisation" is laminar in the pipes
- but not fully linear across the whole network if fittings are present

The fitting coupling used in the pressure-correction system is:

```text
C_fit = -2 A / (K abs(V))
```

## 2.5 Mass conservation and pressure correction

The global system is assembled in `src/netSim/numerics/assembly.py`.

For each component:

```text
m_dot = rho A V
```

and each component contributes:

- a mass imbalance term to the right-hand side
- a coupling coefficient to the matrix

In matrix form the solver is building:

```text
M p' = b
```

where:

- `p'` is the pressure correction
- `b` is built from the current mass-flow imbalance
- `M` comes from the component coupling coefficients

Boundary-pressure nodes are pinned by imposing:

```text
p' = 0
```

at those nodes.
